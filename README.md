# Case 28625 Tests
## Prequisites :
Only a MarkLogic server 9+ instance is necessary
## Configuration
- File gradle.properties in root directory 
should be adapted to choose different mlHost,mlRestPort,mlUsername 
and mlPassword
- The xquery resource service extension could be adapted  
at src/main/ml-modules/service/example.xqy
and any other extension could be added by inserting 
it into this directory
## Execution
Two classes are available :
- SpringRestTemplateTest.java demonstrate the rest client call using payload (multipart/from-data and multipart/mixed)
using Spring RestTemplate 
=> will fail because MarkLogic cannot parse Content-type generated by
RestTemplate containing ;charset=UTF-8 before boundary
 
- OkHttpMultipartTest.java demonstrate the use of OkHttp rest client
=> will succeed both with (multipart/form-data or multipart/mixed) payload

__To execute either of the two classes, it's imperative to use gradle tasks
runOkHttpMultipartTest and runSpringRestTemplateTest__
